# Pattern-Recognition
This program classifies a lung pneumonia dataset into 3 labels: Bacteria, Normal and Virus by deep learning. You can find the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images). In the program, I tried to analyze whether UNet could improve the quality of ResNet18 in images classification. Also, in DA.py, I used 2 data augmentation methods(Horizontal and Vertical flip) to improve the accuracy. I copied the original folder and generated images after DA under the new folder. Finally, I tried Focal Loss function to reduce the training time and improve the quality of model.
